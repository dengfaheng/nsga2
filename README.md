# NSGA-II in julia

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fracta/nsga2/master/doc/images/nsga2.jpg)

Julia implementation of the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II).

This is actually the improved version as devised by *Fortin et al* in which there is sampling
amongst solutions of equal value within each objective (better optimization).
